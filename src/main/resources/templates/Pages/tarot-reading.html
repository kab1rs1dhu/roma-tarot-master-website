                <h2>Illuminate Your Path Through Ancient Wisdom</h2>
                <p>Tarot cards serve as mirrors to our subconscious mind, revealing hidden truths, potential outcomes, and guidance for your life's journey. With a history spanning centuries, these powerful archetypal images create a bridge between your conscious and unconscious awareness.</p>
                <p>Each tarot reading is a sacred conversation between you, the cards, and the universe. As an experienced tarot reader with over two decades of practice, I serve as an interpreter for the symbols and energies that emerge in your reading, offering clarity and insight into your most pressing questions.</p>
                <p>Whether you're seeking guidance about relationships, career decisions, spiritual growth, or simply wish to explore what lies ahead, a personalized tarot reading can illuminate your path forward with wisdom and compassion.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to have a specific question for a reading?</h3>
                    <p>While specific questions can help focus a reading, they're not required. General readings about your current life path or energy can be just as insightful. If you're unsure, we can work together to clarify what information would be most helpful for you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate are tarot readings?</h3>
                    <p>Tarot readings offer insights into current energies, potential outcomes, and hidden influences. They're most accurate when viewed as guidance rather than fixed predictions. Remember that you have free will to shape your future, and the cards illuminate possibilities rather than certainties.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How should I prepare for my reading?</h3>
                    <p>Take some time for quiet reflection before your session. Consider what you most want clarity about. Come with an open mind and heart. For remote readings, find a private, comfortable space where you won't be interrupted. Avoid alcohol or substances before your reading.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I get "negative" cards?</h3>
                    <p>There are no inherently "bad" cards in the tarot. Each card offers valuable lessons and insights. Cards that appear challenging often represent important growth opportunities or necessary awareness. I focus on empowering interpretations that help you navigate all life situations with wisdom.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should I get a tarot reading?</h3>
                    <p>This varies by individual and situation. For ongoing guidance, once every 3-6 months provides a good balance. For specific situations, a reading at the beginning and perhaps a follow-up can be helpful. I discourage becoming dependent on readings for daily decisions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you offer remote/online readings?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I provide readings via video call (Zoom, FaceTime, etc.) or phone. Remote readings can be just as powerful as in-person sessions. For video calls, I position the camera so you can see the cards as they're drawn and interpreted.</p>
